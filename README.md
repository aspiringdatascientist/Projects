# Projects
A collection of all DS projects including capstone projects

1. Capstone 1 - Pittsburgh Bike Share Ridership Demand Prediction :
This Capstone Project explores on predicting the total number of bikes rented from
individual stations for Healthy Ride operated by Pittsburgh Bike Share on any given day.
Machine Learning algorithms were used to create a prediction model using data from
several sources. Prior to developing the model, the data obtained was cleaned and explored.
Tools used:
• Data Wrangling using Pandas
• Data Visualization using seaborn and Matplotlib
• Inferential Statistics using SciPy and frequentist approach
- Hypothesis testing: Upper one-tailed upper z-test and Two-sample bootstrap hypothesis
test for difference of means.
• Machine Learning using scikit-learn
- Regression Algorithms: Lasso, Ridge, Support_vector, Linear Regression, Random
Forest, Decision Trees, xgboosting, Gradient-Boosting

2. Capstone 2 - Twitter Sentiment Analysis of Electoral College in US:
The goal of this project is to predict Twitter users’ political sentiment about electoral college
in U.S. for the given Twitter post using Python based Machine learning NLP Classification
model. What is being said about Electoral College on social media? How has the sentiment
changed over the years? This project explores on answering these questions and predicting
how positive, neutral or negative each tweet is about electoral college.

4. Relax challenge:

Relax Inc. makes productivity and project management software that's popular with both individuals and teams. Founded by several former Facebook employees, it's considered a great company to work at. The challenge is to identify  which  factors  predict  future  user
adoption by defining an "adopted user" as a user who has logged into the product on 3 separate days in at least one 7-day period.
